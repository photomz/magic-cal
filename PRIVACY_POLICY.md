# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 22 February 2024

Welcome to the Magic Event Creator Chrome Extension ("Extension", "we", "us", or "our"). Our Extension allows users to create Google Calendar events using natural language processing powered by ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo). This privacy policy aims to inform you about how we collect, use, and share your information when you use our Extension.

## Information Collection and Use

To provide and improve our Extension, we collect certain information from users. Currently, we collect only the timezone information of our users to accurately create calendar events according to their local time. This collection is essential for the functionality of our Extension.

We do not collect any personal information such as names, email addresses, or calendar event details directly through our Extension. However, our Extension requires an active internet connection to use ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo) for processing natural language inputs into calendar events.

## Future Changes to Information Collection

We reserve the right to collect additional information in the future to improve the functionality and user experience of our Extension. Any such changes will be reflected in an updated version of this privacy policy with a clear explanation of the new types of information collected and their intended use.

## Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share or disclose any collected information with third parties, except as required by law or to protect our rights and the security of our Extension and its users.

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the information we collect against loss, theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification. However, no internet transmission is entirely secure or error-free. We recommend that users also take steps to protect their personal information online.

## Children's Privacy

Our Extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13.

## Contact Information

For any questions, concerns, or complaints regarding this privacy policy or our handling of personal information, please contact us at markuszhang8@gmail.com.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updatedz" at the top of this Privacy Policy. Users are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

By using our Extension, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this privacy policy.
